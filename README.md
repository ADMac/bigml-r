This repo contains the source code used to generate the bigml api bindings 
for R.

There is a small bundle.R script that will build a CRAN-ready bundle.
[Roxygen2]{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html} is 
necessary for building the package documentation.  Simply run the script in 
the project directory.
